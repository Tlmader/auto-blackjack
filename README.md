An automatic Blackjack game using predefined player strategies.

To start the game, a dealer deals two cards to everyone. Then the game
proceeds in a clockwise fashion. Each player chooses whether to hit or stand.
When a player hits, they receive another card. If they stand, they stop receiving
cards. If the value of a playerâ€™s hand goes above 21, they bust and lose the
round.
